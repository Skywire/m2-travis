# M2 travis configuration

## Installation

Copy to Magento root directory.

## Usage

Travis file covers unit, integration and api-functional tests. If you are not using any of these suites in your project then you can remove them from the matrix. Each matrix entry launches a travis instance, so it's best to only use the suites you require.
